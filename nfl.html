                      <p class="dark">
                        We are no longer in the Era of the Quarterback. We are in the Era of the Running Back.

The lush and risky four-year, $60 million contract extension the Rams signed Todd Gurley to Tuesday, according to a source, illustrates that. And there are more running back deals on the horizon that might be wealthier.

While quarterback remains the most important position, the running back is re-emerging as the most dominant one. That may seem like a contradiction, but it's not.

As a team source with the Rams explained, "Quarterbacks are the prize, but running backs are the warriors."

Translation: Pass-throwers are still the key in a passing league, but runners like Gurley, on teams that don't have Tom Brady, Aaron Rodgers or Russell Wilson, are the players who actually win games.

                    </p>

                    </iframe>
                      <p>

                      Running backs have signed big-money deals before, but it's been decades since teams, frightened by the threat of injury at one of the more injury-prone positions, flushed them with large amounts of guaranteed cash.

                      It's also been a long time since we've seen runners outshine quarterbacks in popularity and importance. But we are starting to see exactly that.

                      It's like the NFL has stepped into a time machine and traveled back to the 1990s, when players like Barry Sanders, Emmitt Smith and Thurman Thomas ruled the Earth.

                      After Gurley, Pittsburgh's Le'Veon Bell likely will get an even bigger deal at some point in the future, and he even tweeted about Gurley's deal Tuesday. And there are already league rumblings that Arizona's David Johnson will get a significant pay raise from his rookie deal by the time the season starts.
