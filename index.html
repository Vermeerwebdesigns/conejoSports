                <p class="dark">
            The 2018 world cup is over and many will say that this was one of the most exciting World
            Cups compared to previous cups, From the high unusual scoring to underdogs beating the
            established teams like Spain vs Russia & Japan vs Colombia. Croatia was one of the most
            surprising teams of the world cup that made it to the finals against France, Even though
            in the end France won the title of word champions, Croatia won the heart’s and respect of
            many. <br>
<br>
            Russia hosted this years World Cup and did not only put together a well coordinated event but also
            delivered a good performance on the soccer field beating Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Spain up until
            they lost against Uruguay. <br>
<br>
            The US did not participate in the world cup and according to Bloomberg, viewership was the most
            impacted by this statistic . In fact, this year only half of the US viewership was accounted for
             when compared to the 2014 World Cup. Those who follow have high expectations to join the 2022 World
              Cup in Qatar<br>
<br>
            In the USA, Soccer is still a growing sport and many questions still linger about the World Cup.
            Conejo Sports has compiled a list of the Top 10 most controversial questions about Neymar & the
            2018 World Cup.
<br>
<br>
                      </p>

                      <!--TOP 5 QUESTIONS-->

          <h3>1. Why do soccer players dive so much?</h3>

	<p>Most people would think of Neymar when discussing this question due to
   his recent performance in this year's 2018 World Cup. Neymar has been
   laughed at due to his humorous outbursts on the field and in spite of this,
   internet meme’s have been created about him and his diving tactics.

  But no matter how funny it is to see this, the reality of the sport is this, diving is a crucial
 part of the sport and will never go away. It's a tactic based on Cost/Benefit which includes where
  to fall rather then when to fall. Most player would prefer to dive in side the goalie box in hope to
   fooling the referee hopefully resulting in a penalty shot. Most people don't agree with this but even the
    most “die hard” fans know that this is part of the game. </p>

    <h3>2. Why is the Qatar hosting the 2022 World Cup?</h3>

  <p>  One of the reasons FIFA has mentioned  to support the bidding of the 2022 world
     cup in Qatar was their desired to expand the sport in regions of the world where
      the world cup has never been held previously.  However this decision was not without
       controversy. Allegations of bribery and payouts have been mentioned and some people
        accused FIFA of being corrupted for allegedly taking payment for their votes.  FIFA
         has modified their voting process to avoid corruption but many think that there is
          much more to do in order to clean up the voting process.  So far Qatar has decided
           to move the game to winter time to avoid health issues to the players but winter
           temperature in Qatar could be still pretty hot about 86 degrees. </p>


           <h3>3. Did France really win the World Cup?</h3>

           <p>
             Of course, France won the world cup defeating
              a very talented Croatian team.  This was done
               fair and square, but the controversy arose after
                their winning celebration to some people calling
                 into question their player's African heritage.
                 Trevor Noah from the Daily Show practically threw
                  wood to the fire in his July 18th show.  The video
                   is below and we will let it speak for itself.

                               </iframe>

              <h3>4. The VAR… a good innovation for soccer?</h3>

              <p>Video-Assisted Referee is a technology brought
                from other sports such as American Football to
                 review referee decisions and retracted them if necessary.
                  This technology is no new at all but to FIFA  and soccer
                   fans that prefer a more traditional version of soccer were
                    afraid that this would have killed the flair of the game.
                     The 2018 world cup is the first cup ever integrating this
                      technology and many believe it was a success in its implementation.
                       Definitely a positive for the sport.

              </p>


              <h3>5. Messi, Ronaldo & Neymar miss opportunity?</h3>

              <p> Many “big name” players such as Messi, Ronaldo & Neymar Have
                 to wait until the next world cup to have the opportunity of
                  obtaining the only title they do not possess so far, proving
                   the challenges of becoming a world champion.  For Messi and
                    Ronaldo the pressure is mounting to deliver a winning world
                     cup since they will be older in the next 4 years.  Messi is
                      currently 31 years old, and Ronaldo is 34 and passed their
                       football prime in relation to their ages.  Neymar is still young
                        at 26 years old, he has time to achieve his goals.  Many believe
                         that the fact of them not winning the world cup is a reflection
                         of them spending more time in international soccer clubs where their
                          skills and coordination with teams and the lack of familiarity with
                           the style of their country teammates.
